While the Python Shell is great for quick tests or learning simple commands, it is not ideal for writing longer programs. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VS Code makes it easier to write, edit, and organize code in files. It highlights mistakes, suggests code completions, and lets you run entire programs with one click.

Using an IDE helps you stay organized as your projects grow. You can write comments, save your work, and see output clearly in one place. For beginners and experienced developers alike, an IDE makes coding smoother and more enjoyable.
