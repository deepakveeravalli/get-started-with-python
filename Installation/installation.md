## 📘 Introduction to Python

Python is a popular programming language known for its simple and readable syntax. It is often the first language people learn because it feels close to everyday English and is easy to write and understand. Python can be used to build websites, automate tasks, analyze data, create software, and much more. It works across different platforms and has a large community that supports learning and problem-solving. Whether you are just starting out or looking to explore new ideas, Python offers a smooth and friendly way to begin your programming journey. It grows with you as you learn.

## 🛠 Installing Python

Before you start writing Python code, you need to install Python on your computer. The process is simple and takes just a few minutes.

### 🔹 Step 1: Download Python

Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)
Click on the download button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). The latest stable version is usually recommended.

### 🔹 Step 2: Run the Installer

After downloading, open the installer.
For Windows users, **make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH”** before clicking “Install Now.” This step helps you run Python from any folder using the command prompt.

### 🔹 Step 3: Verify the Installation

Once installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the version number printed, which means Python is ready to use. As you can see below, I've 3.13.5 version installed on my machine.

## 🐚 Getting Started with the Python Interpreter

The **Python Interpreter** is a simple way to write and run Python code directly. It is often the first tool people use to test ideas or learn the basics.
It is an interactive shell that lets you type and run Python code one line at a time. It works by interpreting your commands immediately, which means it reads and runs the code as you type it. You can open the shell by typing `python` in your terminal after installation. When you see `>>>`, it means Python is ready. You can try math, print messages, or test small bits of code. It is a great way to learn and experiment. When you are done, type `exit()` to close the shell. No files are needed to get started.


### 🔹 How to Open It

After installing Python, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```python
python3
```

This will start the Python Shell. You will see something like this:

```
>>>
```

The `>>>` prompt means Python is ready for you to type a command.

### 🔹 Try It Out

Type the following and press Enter:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

You should see:

```
Hello, Python!
```

You just ran your first Python command in the shell.

>`Let us do some basic mathematical (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponential) and comparision operations in Python Interactive shell.`

    5 + 4 is 9
    5 - 4 is 1
    5 * 4 is 20
    5 / 4 is 1.25
    5 ** 2 is 25 (exponential)
    5 > 4 is True
    5 < 4 is False
    5 == 5 is True

🛑 **Syntax Error**

A syntax error happens when you write code that Python doesn't understand. It's like making a grammar mistake in a sentence. If something is missing or typed incorrectly, Python will stop and show an error message.

```python
print("Hello, world!   # Missing closing quote
```

### 🔹 To Exit the Shell

To close the Python Shell, type:

```python
exit()
```

Or press `Ctrl + Z` on Windows or `Ctrl + D` on macOS/Linux and then press Enter.
