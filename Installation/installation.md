## 🛠 Installing Python

Before you start writing Python code, you need to install Python on your computer. The process is simple and takes just a few minutes.

### 🔹 Step 1: Download Python

Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)
Click on the download button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). The latest stable version is usually recommended.

### 🔹 Step 2: Run the Installer

After downloading, open the installer.
For Windows users, **make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH”** before clicking “Install Now.” This step helps you run Python from any folder using the command prompt.

### 🔹 Step 3: Verify the Installation

Once installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the version number printed, which means Python is ready to use. As you can see below, I've 3.13.5 version installed on my machine.

## 🐚 Getting Started with the Python Interpreter

The **Python Interpreter** is a simple way to write and run Python code directly. It is often the first tool people use to test ideas or learn the basics.
It is an interactive shell that lets you type and run Python code one line at a time. It works by interpreting your commands immediately, which means it reads and runs the code as you type it. You can open the shell by typing `python` in your terminal after installation. When you see `>>>`, it means Python is ready. You can try math, print messages, or test small bits of code. It is a great way to learn and experiment. When you are done, type `exit()` to close the shell. No files are needed to get started.


### 🔹 How to Open It

After installing Python, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```python
python3
```

This will start the Python Shell. You will see something like this:

```
>>>
```

The `>>>` prompt means Python is ready for you to type a command.

### 🔹 Try It Out

Type the following and press Enter:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

You should see:

```
Hello, Python!
```

You just ran your first Python command in the shell.

>Let us do some basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponential) in Python Interactive shell.

    5 + 4 is 9
    5 - 4 is 1
    5 * 4 is 20
    5 / 4 is 1.25
    5 ** 2 is 25 (exponentioal form)

### 🔹 To Exit the Shell

To close the Python Shell, type:

```python
exit()
```

Or press `Ctrl + Z` on Windows or `Ctrl + D` on macOS/Linux and then press Enter.
